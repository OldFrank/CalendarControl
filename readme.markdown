## Calendar Control

Fork of the great [AFCalendarControl](http://code.google.com/p/calendarcontrol/) by Keith Duncan. 

 AFCalendar control is part of [AmberKit](http://code.google.com/p/amber-framework/). Current trunk version (as of Sept'2010) does not compile properly.
This is a fork which includes just the Month Calendar Control, and the part of the AmberKit needed to compile it.

Besides, some other changes have been made:

* Support for weeks not beginning on Sunday
* Support for other calendar besides Gregorian
* System/time and Locale change detection
